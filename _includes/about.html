                     <p>A.J. Fillo is a PhD candidate in Mechanical Engineering at Oregon State University (OSU).
                     His specialty is thermal and fluid sciences, with a focus in combustion.  A.J. recieved his
                     Masters of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Oregon State University in December of 2016. 
                     Advised by Dr. David L. Blunck, his masters thesis presented an unpresidented experimental 
                     investigation and anaylsis of the turbulent flame speeds of liquid jet fuels.  A.J. us currently advised by 
                     Dr. Kyle E. Niemeyer and is continuing his investigation of liquid jet fuels computationally with the 
                     direct numerical simulation code NGA.  His initial work on multi-component mass diffusion has been well
                     recieved by the combustion community.  As a Ph.D. Candidate A.J. also serves as a substitute lecturer for
                     OSU faulty and mentor for undergrate students in his lab.</p>

                     <p>In addition to his academic pursuits, A.J. has five years of experience as a professional magician and actor.  
                     Combining his love of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) A.J. has founded two
                     outreach program at Oregon State University and in the local Corvallis, Benton-County Community.  These projects are:
                     <em>Project X: STEAM Outreach</em>, an OSU student group co-founded by Kyle Zada, and <em>Lib Lab</em>, short for Library Laboratory, 
                     created, written, directed, and hosted by AJ Fillo and produced in partnership by the Corvallis-Benton County 
                     Public Library.  Both projects work to break down the barriers kids face in accessing STEAM education and highlight
                     A.J.'s passion and desire to bring STEAM education to all.</p>
