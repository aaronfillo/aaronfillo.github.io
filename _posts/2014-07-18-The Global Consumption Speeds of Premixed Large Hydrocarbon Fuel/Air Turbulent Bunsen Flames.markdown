description: <p>An improved understanding of the turbulent combustion of large-hydrocarbon fuels used in transportation technologies is currently needed. This is motivated by the significance of the turbulent flame speeds in evaluating combustion models, and the ubiquity of large-hydrocarbon fuels. In my thesis I investigate the effects of local turbulent fluctuation on global combustion phenomenon such as the turbulent flame speed for these large-hydrocarbon fuels.</p><p><a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1957/60072">Access Full Text Here</a></p>
