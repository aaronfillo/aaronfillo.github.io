Our mission goals require a wide range of skills from many different areas including: engineering, graphic design, video editing, writing, teaching, performing, etc. We very much work off the adage, “The more the merrier.” You can't spell STEAM without TEAM.</p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/projectxsteam">More Info Click Here</a></p>
