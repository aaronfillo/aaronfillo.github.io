description: <h4>Mission</h4><p>Founded by AJ Fillo and Kyle Zada Project X is dedicated to connecting Oregon State University faculty interested in sponsoring outreach in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM) fields with Oregon State University graduate and undergraduate students dedicated to completing STEAM outreach activities. All outreach activates undertaken by Project X will focus on providing both students and educators the tools necessary to enable student success in STEAM fields.</p><p>Who Can Get involved?  Project X is open to all Oregon State University undergraduate and graduate students; we welcome all majors. Our mission goals require a wide range of skills from many different areas, such as engineering, graphic design, video editing, writing, teaching, performing, etc. We very much work off the adage, “The more the merrier.” You can't spell STEAM without TEAM.<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/projectxsteam" class="btn btn-success btn-lg"></i>More Info Click Here</a></p>
